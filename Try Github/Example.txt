An essay is a piece of writing that methodically analyses and evaluates a topic or issue.  

Fundamentally, an essay is designed to get your academic opinion on a particular matter.

Many students get confused about the word 'opinion' in academic writing, 

and think that academic writing should just stick to reporting the facts and forget about opinion altogether.
